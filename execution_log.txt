MoSEs Framework Implementation Summary

==================================================

Training samples: 200

Test samples: 50

Accuracy: 0.380

F1 Score: 0.392

Average Confidence: 0.591

==================================================

Note: This is a simplified implementation with synthetic data.

For real applications, use actual linguistic features and

pre-trained embeddings like BGE-M3 for better performance.

MoSEs Framework Implementation Summary

==================================================

Training samples: 200

Test samples: 50

Accuracy: 0.520

F1 Score: 0.500

Average Confidence: 0.579

==================================================

Note: This is a simplified implementation with synthetic data.

For real applications, use actual linguistic features and

pre-trained embeddings like BGE-M3 for better performance.
